# GetBackToMe

This is a working title for a Work in Progress. The goal of the project is a "mailgrabber" system connected to specific event triggers. For example, "Get back to me when you support Amex", "Ship to Europe", or "are available for public beta". The idea is to provide highly targeted leads tracked by given milestones, and then be able to contact people when those milestones are met. In production it would probably be called something more business-focused, like TargetedEventLeads.

## Application Structure

The application is build on a fairly standard model for a SinglePageApp based Software-as-a-Service system. A RESTful API exists, but current test and demo data is generated by Ember Mirage.

Little of the site is actively functional, some is speculative or representative, such as an embeddable widget for a mail and ability to trigger emails.

Layout is done through the Bulma framework to use its Flex implementation, and CSS customization is in scss. 

## ToDo

- [ ] Finish application
- [ ] Allow create embeddable widgets
- [ ] Support multiple triggers on a widget with selection
